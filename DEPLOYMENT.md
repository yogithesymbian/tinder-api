# Deployment Guide for Render.com

This guide will help you deploy the Tinder API Laravel application with PostgreSQL on Render.com's free tier.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- A Render.com account (free tier available at https://render.com)
- This repository pushed to GitHub

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Using Render Blueprint (Recommended - Easiest)

1. **Push this repository to GitHub** (if not already done)

2. **Go to Render Dashboard**
   - Visit https://dashboard.render.com
   - Sign in or create a free account

3. **Create New Blueprint**
   - Click "New" → "Blueprint"
   - Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
   - Select this repository (`yogithesymbian/tinder-api`)
   - Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Apply" to create all services defined in `render.yaml`
   - Render will create:
     - PostgreSQL database (free tier)
     - Web service for the Laravel application (free tier)
   - Wait for the deployment to complete (first deployment may take 5-10 minutes)

5. **Access Your Application**
   - Once deployed, you'll get a URL like: `https://tinder-api.onrender.com`
   - API Documentation will be available at: `https://tinder-api.onrender.com/api/documentation`

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up services manually:

#### Step 1: Create PostgreSQL Database

1. Go to Render Dashboard → "New" → "PostgreSQL"
2. Configure:
   - **Name**: `tinder-api-db`
   - **Database**: `tinder_db`
   - **User**: `tinder_user`
   - **Region**: Choose closest to you
   - **Plan**: Free
3. Click "Create Database"
4. Note down the connection details (will be used in web service)

#### Step 2: Create Web Service

1. Go to Render Dashboard → "New" → "Web Service"
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure:
   - **Name**: `tinder-api`
   - **Runtime**: PHP
   - **Build Command**: `./render-build.sh`
   - **Start Command**: `./render-start.sh`
   - **Plan**: Free

4. **Add Environment Variables**:
   ```
   APP_ENV=production
   APP_DEBUG=false
   APP_KEY=base64:[generated by Laravel]
   DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
   DB_HOST=[from database internal connection string]
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_DATABASE=tinder_db
   DB_USERNAME=tinder_user
   DB_PASSWORD=[from database credentials]
   SESSION_DRIVER=database
   CACHE_STORE=database
   QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
   LOG_CHANNEL=stack
   LOG_LEVEL=info
   ```

5. Click "Create Web Service"

## Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations

- **Web Service**: Spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity (first request after spin-down may take 30-60 seconds)
- **Database**: 
  - 1 GB storage
  - Expires after 90 days (you'll need to backup and recreate)
  - Single database instance
- **Build Time**: Limited to 15 minutes per deploy

### Database Migrations

Migrations run automatically on every deployment via the `render-start.sh` script. The database schema will be created on first deployment.

### Environment Variables

The application is configured to use environment variables from Render. You can update them in the Render Dashboard under your web service → "Environment" tab.

### Monitoring and Logs

- View logs in Render Dashboard → Select your service → "Logs" tab
- Monitor performance and uptime in the "Metrics" tab

### Custom Domain (Optional)

On Render's paid plans, you can add a custom domain:
1. Go to your web service settings
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed by Render

## API Endpoints

Once deployed, your API will be available at:

- **Base URL**: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/v1`
- **Swagger Documentation**: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/documentation`

### Available Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/v1/login` - Login user
- `POST /api/v1/logout` - Logout user (requires authentication)
- `GET /api/v1/people` - Get list of people (requires authentication)
- `POST /api/v1/people/{id}/like` - Like a person (requires authentication)
- `POST /api/v1/people/{id}/dislike` - Dislike a person (requires authentication)
- `GET /api/v1/people/liked` - Get liked people (requires authentication)

## Testing the Deployment

1. **Check Health**: Visit your app URL - you should see the Laravel welcome page
2. **Check API Docs**: Visit `/api/documentation` for Swagger UI
3. **Test Registration**: Use the Swagger UI to register a test user
4. **Test Login**: Login with the test user credentials
5. **Test Protected Routes**: Use the bearer token from login to access protected endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

- Check build logs in Render Dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in `composer.json`
- Verify PHP version compatibility (requires PHP 8.2+)

### Database Connection Fails

- Verify database credentials in environment variables
- Check database is running and accessible
- Ensure PostgreSQL database is in the same region as web service for best performance

### Application Errors

- Check application logs in Render Dashboard
- Enable debug mode temporarily: Set `APP_DEBUG=true` (remember to disable in production)
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly

### Slow First Request

This is normal on free tier - the service spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. Consider upgrading to paid plan for always-on service.

## Alternative Free Deployment Platforms

If Render.com doesn't meet your needs, consider:

1. **Railway.app** - Similar to Render, $5 free credit monthly
2. **Fly.io** - Free tier with limitations
3. **Heroku** - Free tier discontinued, but student pack available
4. **DigitalOcean App Platform** - Free tier for static sites, paid for apps
5. **AWS Free Tier** - EC2 + RDS (more complex setup, requires AWS knowledge)

## Support

For issues specific to this deployment:
- Check Render documentation: https://render.com/docs
- Laravel deployment docs: https://laravel.com/docs/deployment
- Open an issue in this repository

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` file or expose `APP_KEY`
- Use strong database passwords
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor Render's security advisories
- Consider enabling SSL/TLS (automatic on Render)
- Use rate limiting (already configured in routes)

## Updating the Application

To deploy updates:
1. Push changes to your GitHub repository
2. Render will automatically detect changes and redeploy
3. Or manually trigger a deploy from Render Dashboard

Auto-deploy is enabled by default when connecting via GitHub.
